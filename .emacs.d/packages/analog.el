;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Package to keep track of a list of specified files or the output of
;; specified commands. The principal variable to modify is
;; analog-entry-list, which should be set to a list of entries.
;;
;; Each element of analog-entry-list is a list where the car is a file
;; (or command) and the cdr is an association list of properties.
;;
;; By default, entries are files, but commands can also be specified.
;; Each entry can have a list of attributes describing whether the
;; head or the tail of the output is wanted, how many lines should be
;; kept, a list of regexps to keep or flush etc. Entries can be
;; collected into named groups.

;; Here is an example:
;;
;; (setq analog-entry-list
;;       '(
;;         ;; files in the WWW group
;;         ("/var/log/apache/referer.log"

;;          (lines . 10))                  ; show 10 lines
;;         ("/var/log/apache/combined.log"
;;          (group . "WWW")
;;          (lines . 10))
;;         ;; files in the Mail group
;;         ("/var/log/exim/mainlog"

;;         ;; commands in the Commands group

;;          (lines . all))                 ; keep all lines
;;         ("last"

;;          (type . command)
;;          (position . head)              ; monitor the head of the output

;;          (keep . "matt")                ; keep lines matching matt
;;          (hide . ("bash" "ssh" "rxvt")) ; hide/keep can be lists
